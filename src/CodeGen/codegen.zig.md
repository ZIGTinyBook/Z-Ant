## <a name="module-overview"></a>Module Overview

This main module serves as a central import point for all other modules within the project. It leverages Zig's `@import` functionality to efficiently manage dependencies.  There is no core logic contained within this file; it solely facilitates access to other modules.


## <a name="imported-modules"></a>Imported Modules

The following table details the modules imported by this main module and their intended purpose.

| Module Name       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `math_handler.zig` | Provides mathematical functions used throughout the application.  (Details within `math_handler.zig` documentation.) |
| `parameters.zig`   | Defines and manages application parameters and configuration settings. (Details within `parameters.zig` documentation.) |
| `predict.zig`      | Implements prediction algorithms or models. (Details within `predict.zig` documentation.) |
| `skeleton.zig`     | Contains the core data structures and fundamental building blocks of the system. (Details within `skeleton.zig` documentation.) |
| `globals.zig`      | Manages global variables and state. (Details within `globals.zig` documentation.) |
| `tests.zig`        | Contains unit tests for various parts of the application. (Details within `tests.zig` documentation.) |
| `utils.zig`        | Provides utility functions used across multiple modules. (Details within `utils.zig` documentation.) |


This modular structure promotes code organization, maintainability, and reusability.  Further details on the functionality of each imported module can be found in their respective documentation files.
